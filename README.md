üß† Features

User profile management

Skill offering and requesting system

Swap request tracking

MySQL database integration

üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Prerequisites

Java JDK 8+

MySQL Server

MySQL JDBC Driver (e.g., mysql-connector-java)

IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or build tools (like Maven/Gradle)


Database Configuration

Create a database named skillswap in MySQL:

CREATE DATABASE skillswap;

Update credentials in DBUtil.java:

private static final String USER = "root";       // your MySQL username
private static final String PASS = "your-password"; // your MySQL password

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget to secure your credentials in production use.

üöÄ Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your project.


2. Set up your MySQL database and create required tables.


3. Compile and run the project via your IDE or command line.


4. Expand MainGUI.java for a user interface, or implement a CLI for interaction.

üß© Class Overview

DBUtil.java

Handles the creation of connections to the MySQL database using JDBC.

User.java

Encapsulates user profile data including name, location, skills offered/wanted, availability, and visibility status.

SwapRequest.java

Manages requests between users for skill swaps. It includes status tracking and user references.

MainGUI.java

Placeholder for the future GUI. You can implement Java Swing, JavaFX, or another frontend framework.

‚öôÔ∏è Example MySQL Table Definitions

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    location VARCHAR(100),
    skills_offered TEXT,
    skills_wanted TEXT,
    availability VARCHAR(100),
    is_public BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE swap_requests (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    from_user VARCHAR(100),
    to_user VARCHAR(100),
    offered_skill VARCHAR(100),
    wanted_skill VARCHAR(100),
    status VARCHAR(50)
);

üìå Notes

Code uses basic JDBC, no ORM tools like Hibernate are included.

You can easily extend this to include REST APIs or GUI functionality.

GUI (MainGUI) is currently a stub ‚Äî recommended to implement with JavaFX or Swing.
